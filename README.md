# AltAdder
AltAdder is an online AltSource helper and unoffical successor to CelloSerenity's AltDirect
# Why use AltAdder and not AltDirect?
Quick info glance - AltAdder actually reads the json data of AltSources and shows you the app info and shows you the apps in the AltSource
Entering "google.com" into AltAdder wont do anything unlike how AltDirect thinks its a source - this doesnt need a description lol
Supports all the sideloaders AltDirect Does - we support AltStore (Classic, Not PAL), SideStore, Feather, and even LiveContainer!
